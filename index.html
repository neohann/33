                          What is the top three states with the highest number of pet households is an interesting question. Someone may take a guess. New York? Pennsylvania? Nope. If you are interested in this question, this Pet households narrative visualization has the right information for you.</p>
          <p class="lead">
                          Let me first define what is “pet” mean here. It simply means ONLY dogs and cats. Other kinds of animals such as birds and snakes are not included in this data.  
                         <br>
                         
          <p class="lead">
                         

                         California has the highest number of household who has pets. This means if one household has only cats, only dogs or both cats and dogs is included here.  California is the number one in number of pet households. Did you have the right guess?<br>

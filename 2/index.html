                          What is the top three states with the highest number of pet households is an interesting question. Someone may take a guess. New York? Pennsylvania? Nope. If you are interested in this question, this Pet households narrative visualization has the right information for you.</p>
          <p class="lead">
                          Let me first define what is “pet” mean here. It simply means ONLY dogs and cats. Other kinds of animals such as birds and snakes are not included in this data.  
                         <br>
                         
          <p class="lead">
                         

                         California has the highest number of household who has pets. This means if one household has only cats, only dogs or both cats and dogs is included here.  California is the number one in number of pet households. Did you have the right guess?<br>

                <h3>Summary:</h3>
                <p class="lead">Martini Glass structure were used in this narrative visualization. Scene 1, scene 2 and scene 3 are author driven contents which showed the top one, two and three states that has the most pet households. The Scene3 page is the "jumping off point" and leads users to the final scene, scene 4. Scene 4 contains reader driven content. It allows users to interact with the charts and know more detail on what they are interested in. All the Scenes follow the same template.
                 Also, Vega-lite were used in this Visualization.

                </p>
                 
                <h3>In This Scene:</h3>
                
                </p>
                <h3>Annotations</h3>
                  <p class="lead">California is annotated.</p>
                  <h3>Parameters</h3>
                <p class="lead">1 Scene number. In this Scene, it is scene 1.
<p class="lead">2 Ranking of number of pet households. In this scene, California has the highest number of pet households.</p>
<p class="lead">3 States. This parameter is California.</p>
<p class="lead">4 Red highlight state on the map.</p>
                <h3>Triggers</h3>
                <p class="lead">1 The mouse click acts as a trigger event for navigation. The mouse over “California” will trigger for the tooltip in the chart. 
<p class="lead">2 According to the course videos, the trigger could be the connections between parameters. So when clicking “scene 1” and change to scene 1, the ranking of the number of pet household, the states, and red highlight, will be changed.</p>
